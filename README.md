# DigaPractice
I developed this project as an objetive to learn and improve my skills. Like NextJS, TypeScript and CSS-JS.

## About
I looked for a design that I could edit and then changed some things I didn't like or didn't need, so I used the original design as a prototype.
With this project I have practiced new methods and learn moro about TypeScript.
